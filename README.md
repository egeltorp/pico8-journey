# PICO-8 Journey
**Goal:** Avoid AI-assisted coding and learn actual programming fluency through game development in the PICO-8 environment.

## Why PICO-8?
I have quite a bit of previous game dev experience (Godot/Unity) but I must admit I rely too heavily on AI to write/fix/edit code. I'm not terrible att coding but sometimes struggle writing complex systems from scratch. PICO-8's constraints will force me to truly understand programming fundamentals.

**Key advantages:**
- Immediate visual feedback
- Token limits prevent overwhelming complexity
- All code is public for learning
- Fast iteration

## Learning Resources

### Primary Resources
- **PICO-8 Zine #1** (itch.io) - Start here! Beginner tutorials
- **Nerdy Teachers Tutorials** (nerdyteachers.com/PICO-8) - Free video series with bitesize games
- **Official Manual** (pico-8.txt) - Essential reference, read after first tutorial
- **Lexaloffle Forums** (lexaloffle.com/bbs) - Community support and code examples


## Planned Projects

### Beginner Projects
- ~~Breakout variant~~
- ~~Pong/Squashy~~ (following Zine #1)
- Snake game
- Simple space shooter

### Intermediate Projects
- Platformer with basic physics
- Roguelike with procedural generation
- Puzzle game (Sokoban or similar)
- Game jam submission (original concept)

### Advanced Projects
- Top-down adventure (Zelda-style)
- Metroidvania with ability unlocks
- Multiplayer game concept
- Polish and publish best project to itch.io

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundations
- Complete PICO-8 Zine #1 entirely
- Type every line of code myself (no copy/paste)
- Make notes on concepts I don't understand
- Modify tutorial projects to understand mechanics

### Phase 2: Practice
- Follow Nerdy Teachers video tutorials
- Build 2-3 games from scratch with minimal reference
- Study code from published PICO-8 carts
- Focus on: collision detection, game loops, sprite animation

### Phase 3: Creation
- Participate in PICO-8 game jam
- Create original game concept
- Document problems solved without AI assistance
- Share progress with community


## Rules for This Journey

1. **No AI code generation** - I can look up documentation but must write code myself
2. **Type, don't copy/paste** - Even from tutorials, type it out to build muscle memory
3. **Understand before moving on** - Don't skip concepts I don't fully grasp
4. **Commit regularly** - Document progress and learning in this repo
5. **Finish projects** - Better to complete small games than abandon big ideas

## Progress Log

_I'll update this section as I work through projects._
